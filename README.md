## What is a website builder?

A website builder is a programme or tool that allows you to design and create websites without having to edit any code. You can do everything you need to by yourself, without needing a designer or developer. With the specially developed drag-and-drop website builder software, you can simply choose from a vast range of templates and customise them in line with your brand vision!

## How does a website builder work?

Both online and offline website builders exist. Offline website builders need to be installed first before you can start using them. Online website builders are used in a web application, so thereâ€™s no need to install any software.

Online website builders are developed to be easy to use, for both beginners and more experienced designers.

The way a website builder actually works is simple. You start by choosing a template, which defines the look and feel of your website. Next, you simply use a drag-and-drop editor to build your website by editing the template, adding content and creating new pages. Drag-and-drop means literally dragging and dropping components and content into your workspace. You can add headings, texts, images, videos, and many other components. What you see is exactly how your website will appear when it goes live. Our Website Builder gives you a selection of over 140 fully customisable templates. You can easily customise the menu, divide content into columns and change pretty much anything you like!
